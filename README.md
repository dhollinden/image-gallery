## instructions
You are a developer who has been given wireframes for an image gallery page. Your goal is to develop this page using any technology you wish with the following key features. API response data has been provided in a static .json file.

- Search: the user should have the ability to enter text into a search field and see images that match the entered text
- Image Grid: display a grid of image thumbnails, when clicked, a modal should display additional details about the thumbnail (see second wireframe)
- Pagination: Users should be able to page through the list of images, clicking a double arrow (<< or >>) should take the user to the first or last page respectively. clicking a single arrow (< or >) should take the user to the previous or next page respectively
- Image Modal: after a user has clicked on a thumbnail a modal should display showing additional details about the image. Some fields are editable, some are not. Clicking save persists the changes, clicking cancel will discard the changes. See the second wireframe for details
- Additional Features: it is strongly encouraged to add any additional features you feel may be valuable to this page.
